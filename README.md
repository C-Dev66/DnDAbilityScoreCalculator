# DnDAbilityScoreCalculator
This is a console application is used to give DnD characters their stats at the beginning of the game.

// Ability Score Formula
// 1.) Start with a 4d6 roll to get a number between 4 & 24
// 2.) Divide the roll result by 1.75
// 3.) Add 2 to the result of that division
// 4.) Round down to the nearest whole number
// 5.) If the result is too small, use the minimum value of 3

// Note: The CLR keeps track of all of the references to each object, and when the last reference disappears it marks it for removal. 
//       But it might have other things to do right now, so the object could stick around for a few millisecondsâ€”or even longer!
